    <h1>General/Universal Mechanics</h1>
    <p> For new players that are only beginning to learn the unique mechanics that guilty gear offers. Unlike other
        conventional fighting games, there are a variety of mechanics that players must take advantage
        of that are shared amongst most or all characters alike. Knowing the general rules and interactions of all
        mechanics allows for a stronger and more knowledgeable player.</p>

    <h1>Character Info & Useful Links.</h1>
    <p>A noble nightless samurai following the ways of Dandyism, Nagoriyuki entered the battlefield in Strive. He was
        forced by Happy Chaos to become his bodyguard, but eventually breaks free of this curse.
        In combat he uses a daishou pair of swords, which enable large normals. As a nightless, he has a unique resource
        called the "Blood Gauge". He can cancel specials into other specials, but overuse of special moves causes him to
        enter "Blood Rage", which is a fail state that depletes his health and removes his ability to use specials.</p>

    <h2>Fukyo</h2>
    <p>A versatile command dash that increases the Blood Gauge. Essential for every aspect of Nagoriyuki's gameplan,
        from movement and punishment to pressure and combos alike.
        Fukyo has two versions: 236K, which moves forwards, and 214K, which moves backwards. Both versions increase the
        Blood Gauge. Fukyo helps compensate for Nagoriyuki's poor movement. 236K can be used to approach and 214K can be
        used to retreat and to dodge and punish attacks. Both versions leave Nagoriyuki with sliding momentum. The
        momentum can be canceled during recovery by holding the opposite direction. This allows the user to fine tune
        Nagoriyuki's positioning, which is key for moving to the optimal range to keep up pressure. The forward momentum
        of 236K can also be imparted to Nagoriyuki's other special moves and his jumps. The latter half of Fukyo can be
        Special-cancelled into any of his specials except 623P, giving it further versatility in every aspect of his
        gameplan. For example, 236K > 214H grants Nagoriyuki a blazing fast, full-screen lunging attack. Handy when
        approaching a zoning character.
        The forward momentum of 236K can extend combos by being Special-cancelled both into and out of, such as
        following up after 623H or staying in range for multiple c.S. The sliding momentum can also move him into
        position to extend pressure. For example, 236K > c.S on block leaves Nagoriyuki close enough for a Tick Throw
        623P.
        It's easy to mix up 236K and 214K due to them having the same animation. The Back version has much less recovery
        than the Forward one. This allows the user to bait and punish mashing by moving backwards, or condition the
        opponent to expect backward movement and then move forward to open them up with a sudden Throw. For more on
        Fukyo mix-ups, check the Strategy page.
        When inputting the input for for either versions of Fukyo, the button can be held for additional Fukyos without
        reinputting the motion. This allows Nagoriyuki to move faster in a shorter amount of time.
        Fukyo is the glue that binds Nagoriyuki's move set together. Proper use of it is essential for mastering
        Nagoriyuki, so get comfortable with it.

    <h2>Zarameyuki</h2>
    <p>Also referred to as Clone by the community.

        A versatile projectile attack that increases the Blood Gauge. Useful for counter-zoning, closing space and for
        pressure.

        Nagoriyuki fires a body double of himself as a projectile. It starts up with a projectile clashing hitbox before
        becoming a traditional hitbox. It travels full screen quite fast while destroying almost any non-Overdrive
        projectile in the game, making it a very strong anti-zoning tool. 236S > 236K allows the user to advance towards
        the opponent while using the projectile as cover, providing an opportunity for a follow-up attack. This is a key
        approach option, as it allows the user to nullify an enemy projectile and close space at the same time. It is a
        rewarding, albeit Blood Gauge intensive, way to bypass enemy zoning. If 236S > 236K connect, Nagoriyuki can
        combo into f.SSS, mitigating the Blood Gauge increase.

        At close range, Zarameyuki provides strong mix-ups thanks to its high frame advantage on block. For example, c.S
        will interrupt abare attempts after the projectile is blocked, which can be mixed up with a 623P. It is a great
        pressure starter after landing Bloodsucking Universe on the opponent, especially so in the corner.

        Increases Blood Gauge on use (+90/300, or +30%).
        Will clash with and beat most non-Overdrive projectiles.
        Can be canceled into other specials except 623P starting from Frame 15.</p>

    <h2>Kamuriyuki</h2>
    <p>Also referred to as Beyblade or Spin by the community. A nickname that is shared with Bedman's call 4B3.

        Kamuriyuki is a powerful and versatile lunging attack that increases the Blood Gauge. An excellent tool for
        closing space, punishment, pressure and combos. Kamuriyuki can be special cancelled into Nagoriyuki's other
        specials except 623P.

        Thanks to its impressive speed and range, Kamuriyuki is a good option for closing the gap and initiating
        offense. If used unpredictably during neutral, it's likely to interrupt forward movement or score a Counter-Hit.
        It's excellent for punishment and can be used on reaction against very slow moves, such as Ky's Charged Stun
        Edge (236H). If 214H hits close and early in a combo, the knockdown from 214H can combo into 6K/2S OTG. During
        less ideal conditions, the user will need to close space with Fukyo (236K) before using 6K/2S. Alternatively,
        combo 214H into Shizuriyuki (623H) to launch the opponent for a stronger, but more Blood Gauge intensive
        conversion.

        However, the move is -3 on block at close range. This forces the user to Special-cancel or risk being punished
        by a Throw. Nagoriyuki's Special moves put the user in a decent position to play mindgames with the opponent. If
        the opponent attempts to mash on it, a cancel into 623H will Counter-Hit them, whereas 214K can dodge a Throw
        attempt and punish. If the opponent is conditioned to stay passive, they become open to a Throw. 214H also
        yields high reward on Counter-Hit, making it a strong frame trap from moves such as 5H. Note that if only the
        final frames of 214H hit the opponent - such as from max range - Nagoriyuki is -1 on block, which means that
        Special-canceling isn't a must to stay safe. 214H also has airborne frames, allowing it to jump over certain
        attacks, such as Potemkin's Slide Head.

        In conclusion, Kamuriyuki is a phenomenal move. It approaches, it combos, it punishes, it mixes, it slices, it
        dices and it makes julienne fries. However, it will not pay your taxes. Nagoriyuki players are still debating
        how to best work around this significant shortcoming.

    <h2>Shizuriyuki</h2>
    <p>Also referred to as DP by the community.

        A large and versatile two-hit rekka that increases the Blood Gauge. A strong frame trap and combo extender, as
        well as a powerful anti-air and oppressive round start option. Either hit of Shizuriyuki can be cancelled into
        Nagoriyuki's other specials except for 623P

        The 623H input initiates the first hit, and pressing H again initiates the Follow-Up (623HH). The Follow-Up is
        very delayable and can be used on whiff. 623H is a good choice after moves such as Kamuriyuki (214H) on block to
        Counter-Hit an opponent that challenges the user, and the follow-up can cover for the first hit. Both hits yield
        high reward on Counter-Hit, making it a strong conditioning tool. Shizuriyuki is also used to extend combos.
        623H launches the opponent, setting up juggle combos. 623HH causes a ground bounce, allowing for explosive,
        Blood-intensive combos such as 623HH > 214H loops. Shizuriyuki can also lead into a simple low/high mixup by
        cancelling into 623HH or 214H, although this is best done after landing 623P to negate the high Blood cost.

        This move is an oppressive round start option. Even if the opponent evades the first hit by moving back, the
        second hit can dissuade the opponent from punishing it. Challenging Shizuriyuki round start is also extremely
        risky, as most characters have few and low reward options that win against Shizuriyuki. In contrast, Nagoriyuki
        gets a high damage combo that ends in wall break if he lands a CH Shizuriyuki. Shizuriyuki is also strong during
        neutral thanks to its range, disjoint and upper body invulnerability. Sequences like 236K > 623H are the closest
        thing to a jumpscare in Strive, giving the user a large, traveling, low-profile Large CH starter that will blow
        anyone up even slightly asleep at the wheel.


        For an oppressive, dirty and rage-inducing move, look no further than Shizuriyuki. Just don't go too wild with
        it, for 623H still costs Blood to use, as good as it is.

        The first hit increases Blood Gauge on use (+90/300, or +30%).
        The second hit has no effect on the Blood Gauge.

    <h2>Wasureyuki</h2>
    <p>An invincible Overdrive that reduces the Blood Gauge. Useful as an invincible reversal and is a very powerful
        combo tool.

        If the first strike hits up close, it transitions to the cinematic. The Blood Gauge will be temporarily paused
        during the cinematic but will continue increasing or decreasing afterwards. If the opponent is hit with the tip
        of the blade, it will launch them into the air, but will not cause the cinematic. Instead, it grants a
        knockdown. The Blood Gauge reduction will not apply in this scenario. However, the user can extend the combo
        after the opponent falls to the ground, such as by using f.SSS.

        Wasureyuki is an especially powerful reversal due to its high damage and Blood drain, while possessing both
        great start-up and a generous hitbox, though it is punishable on whiff or block. Due to its many hits, it will
        deal considerable damage even after severe scaling late in a combo, making it a powerful finisher in any combo.

        It’s powerful, it’s invincible, it manages Blood and it oozes with style. What’s not to love?

        The final hit of the cinematic lowers Blood Gauge on hit (-194.4/300, or -64.8%).
        Data in [] refers to when the cinematic does not trigger.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Zansetsu</h2>
    <p>A Blood Rage exclusive Overdrive. Primarily a combo finisher, but also works as a sub-par invincible reversal.

        In Blood Rage, Zansetsu is Nagoriyuki’s only overdrive. It reaches full screen, which means it can be confirmed
        off of virtually any strike. Its power is immense, even at the end of a scaled combo. Generally, it should be
        used as quickly as possible to avoid drastic health depletion from Blood Rage.

        However, it is a poor reversal. The hefty startup frames make it tricky to connect, and the long recovery makes
        it consistently punishable by all characters, even if used at a sizable distance. It’s even worse if the
        opponent has 50% Tension, as they can PRC Zansetsu on reaction to the super flash animation.

        Although the following scenarios are rare at higher levels, Zansetsu still has merit during defense or neutral.
        It can become potent against greedy opponents who use moves with a lengthy startup and/or recovery without
        meter. Some examples include:

        Projectile attacks with long total recovery, like Ky's Charged Stun Edge or Leo's H Gravierte Würde.
        Pressure-reset Overdrives with lengthy recovery that typically cannot be challenged like Amorphous or Nostrovia
        Always remember that Zansetsu startup can be react-PRC'd. Opponents with spare meter will be able to punish your
        punish attempt.

        Does not exit Blood Rage mode if it is Roman Canceled before the animation finishes</p>

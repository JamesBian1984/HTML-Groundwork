    <h1>Character Info & Useful Links.</h1>
    <p>Sol is a character who likes to get up close and personal, but does not sacrifice a balanced toolkit to do so.
        Sol has tricky special moves which help him get in, and a suite of normals which excel at setting up frame traps
        and strike/throw mix-ups.

        His f.S is a fast, plus on block poke that lies at the heart of his pressure game. Delay its follow-ups to
        create oppressive frame traps and mix in dash pressure and throws for a deadly strike/throw mix-up. He's also
        armed with powerful mid-ranged tools such as 6S, a sizeable poke, and Gun Flame, a mid-ranged projectile that is
        plus on block if it hits meaty or at max range. Tools like these provide him with a strong neutral presence. At
        longer ranges, he can close the gap and initiate pressure with Fafnir, a forward-lunging Guard Crush.

        Proper conditioning is a huge part of Solâ€™s gameplan. For example, conditioning the opponent to jump, attack, or
        backdash upon seeing certain attacks opens up opportunities to punish these responses. His immense damage output
        massively rewards hard reads. Sol also boasts a set of versatile defensive moves that complement universal
        defensive mechanics. These include Volcanic Viper, a fast DP which can be used to challenge pressure, and 2D, a
        low profile sweep that can slip under many attacks. Night Raid Vortex is also evasive, though it is more
        committal and aggressive in nature. Lastly, his 6P is a fast and reliable tool for anti-airing and counter
        poking.

        With ferocious pressure, strong defense, versatile special moves and explosive power, this badass bounty hunter
        is armed with everything an offensively oriented player could ask for.</p>

    <h2>Volcanic Viper</h2>
    <p>Meterless invulnerable reversal to escape pressure.

        Use it to steal momentum against okizeme and predictable pressure. Its invulnberability while grounded and
        massive disjointed hitbox during ascent makes it a useful anti-air, but be warned that Sol is punshable on block
        if they land close enough. Can be Roman Canceled on hit for decent damage and better okizeme. Doing this on
        block gives Sol an advantage to take his turn, forcing the opponent to bait it by giving up space instead of
        blocking.

        Only use the air version if strike invulnerability is desperately needed while in mid-air, such as after an
        opponent uses Roman Cancel.

        Air version has shorter active time compared to the ground version.
        H Volcanic Viper (623H)
        A variant of Volcanic Viper suited to combos instead of as a reversal, as its invulnerability frames don't begin
        immediately but instead can "Clean Hit" by connecting at point-blank range.

        Sol launches significantly higher, leaving him very punishable on whiff or ground block. No reliable utility as
        an anti-air due to its incredibly slow start-up. The Clean Hit deals absolutely massive damage and gives strong
        okizeme, so it should be used to end combos whenever possible.

        The air version has an even stronger launch, making it an ideal combo ender and potential extender, able to
        Clean Hit after most air normals so long as Sol is very close to the opponent and has forward momentum from a
        forward jump or air dash (j.D only works in the corner). The air version is also common after c.S with a jump
        cancel. Ending a combo with it allows for OTGs or a safe jump setup with backward jump j.P into air dash j.H.

        Second hit can Clean Hit at close range. Only occurs if the first hit successfully connected.
        Data in [ ] represents values on Clean Hit.
        Clean Hit deals greatly enhanced damage, increases launch distance, and grants hard knockdown.
        Launches opponent on hit.
        Counter Hit state during recovery.
        Cannot Roman Cancel unless the opponent is in hitstun or blockstun.</p>

    <h2>Bandit Bringer</h2>
    <p>Sol floats in the air before doing a very fast dive able to crush through anti-airs.

        Hits overhead, but very reactable, instead more effective to vault over opponent's abare. Very safe on block,
        placing Sol in a safe spacing, able to threaten 2K or S Volcanic Viper to continue offense if needed. On hit,
        grants an effective hard knockdown for strong okizeme and leads to a combo on Counter Hit by dashing forward
        with 5K.

        Can be plus on block if it connects at a very far spacing.

        Aerial Bandit Bringer (j.214K)

        Much worse recovery, leaving Sol punishable on block, however it can be delayed to halt Sol's momentum in the
        air. This is especially useful for baiting out an opponent's anti-air attempts, however it can still lose to
        attacks with very high vertical reach like Potemkin's Heat Knuckle or Faust's 6P. Despite being punishable on
        block, it's an important tool to strengthen Sol's air approach when combined with his air normals and mobility,
        so don't be afraid to throw it in as a mix-up.

        When fully charged, the aerial version will cause a large ground bounce on hit, granting it much greater reward
        in the corner even without a Counter Hit. It can also be used to end air combos for okizeme, but can be
        difficult to combo into due to its slower startup.

        Aerial version can be charged by holding K.
        Data in [ ] represents values when fully charged.
        Slight ground bounce on hit, hard knockdown upon landing.
        Larger ground bounce when aerial version is fully charged.
        Crouching state during landing recovery.</p>

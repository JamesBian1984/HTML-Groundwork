    <h1>Character Info & Useful Links.</h1>
    <p>Slayer is a sophisticated vampire who dominates neutral with his dandyism. While his kit is unconventional, he
        has a number of unique tools for mixing up or whiff punishing the opponent to keep them on their toes.

        Slayer's neutral revolves around his signature Dandy Step as well as his unique teleport dash. His normal
        attacks such as f.S and 5H have relatively low range, requiring him to utilize his movement options to get in
        and enforce pressure. Dandy Step's many followups allow Slayer to threaten overheads, lows, and pressure resets
        in addition to his infamous Pilebunker for devastating whiff punishes.

        While Slayer's combos are relatively short, his exceptional damage potential and number of ways to open up the
        opponent make him a serious threat when he is in range to pressure the opponent. Alternating between the low
        Bump Ahead followup and the overhead It's Late followup can allow Slayer to easily convert either with meter or
        via his UNIVERSE mechanic, and Bloodsucking Universe acts as a powerful command grab option to reinforce his
        neutral game and gain access to better combo starters.

        With an assortment of dandy strikes and his lovely wife cheering him on, this formidable ex-assassin hasn't lost
        his killing touch.

    <h2>Mappa Punch</h2>
    <p>A lunging punch with fast startup, allowing it to easily combo from normal moves. A good way for Slayer to move
        around the screen and bully his opponent, staying just out of the range of their normals while using Mappa to
        close in.

        P Version
        Goes a shorter distance, but is faster overall than the K version. It combos from lights easily, giving Slayer
        decent reward for mashing, and is generally very safe to throw out even in neutral due to how quickly it
        recovers. It keeps the opponent standing on hit, so you usually have to hit a button after it to get the
        opponent to sit still.

        K Version
        Slower and goes significantly further. Compared to P Mappa, it's punishable if misspaced, but works better as a
        hitconfirm or combo ender as it will knock down with significant corner carry. Additionally, because it has a
        longer travel distance, it's possible to use it from further out and gain additional safety; spacing this move
        properly will make it either impossible to punish or even plus on block. On Counter Hit, Slayer can link into 5K
        anywhere.

        Keep in mind that at most ranges where Slayer can use K Mappa, the opponent can low profile the move and punish
        Slayer, so don't overuse it.

        Can be used with a kara cancel to reach even further distances.</p>

    <h2>Dandy Step</h2>
    <p>A character-defining command movement option with a number of followups. Dandy Step is the key to every facet of
        Slayer's gameplan, giving him access to confusing and intimidating mixups in order to overwhelm his opponents as
        well as whiff punish them like few other characters can.

        P Version
        Faster, travels forward, and can cross up the opponent when close. Its exceptional speed makes it a viable combo
        tool off of launchers like 2H, or in counterhit confirms to close the distance before picking up with a normal.
        This version is suited more to combos and mixups, as the forward movement renders it vulnerable to being stuffed
        if it's used carelessly. It's typically very weak in blockstrings, since it always leaves a gap where it can be
        thrown at close range regardless of the chosen followup.

        K Version
        Slayer slides backwards, then slides forwards past his original position. This move can be used to evade attacks
        and score a devastating whiff punish. During pressure, it can be used to avoid the opponent's mashing and punish
        them, though its backwards movement also limits the amount of possible mixups available to Slayer if they don't
        take the bait.</p>
